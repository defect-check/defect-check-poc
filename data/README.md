# Contribution instructions

[] Pull from the repository so that you can see the latest data and avoid repeating annotations.

[] Launch the via.html application from this folder. This is important so it can locate the image files.

[] Before annotation, save your project ending it with {filename}-{start}-{end}.json. start and end show the range you intend to annotate. Commit and push to ensure no one duplicates your work. Let the filename show that the work is not yet finished.

[] After annotation, do the same.
